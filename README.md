# ump-sdk
SDK for Sensapex uMp micromanipulators.

This is legacy SDK version that has been transferred to maintentance mode.

For new users and application development we recommend starting with umsdk, which is the new major development branch and includes support for all Sensapex uMx products.

Generate doxygen documentation and examine doc/html/index.html for details.

There is a sample C-application in src/sample/ and example matlab and labview scripts in examples/ .

Precompiled windows binaries can be found in

and precompiled Doxygen documentation in
